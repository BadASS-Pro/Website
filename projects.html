						<p>While Congress and Sangh Parivar are engaged in a debate over the legacy of former Congress chief minister R Sankar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday joined the issue by trying to establish how the late Ezhava leader had been close to Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mukherjee.</p>
						<p>Unveiling a statue of Sankar, a prominent Hindu Ezhava leader and former general secretary of community outfit SNDP Yogam, Modi said in Kollam that Sankar had invited Mukherjee for a maha sammelan of the Hindu Mandalam, which he had formed with Hindu Nair leader Mannath Padmanabhan.</p>
						<p>“R Sankar along with Mannath Padmanabhan had formed a maha sakthi, Hindu Mandalam. They had invited Jana Sangh leader Syama Prasad Mukherjee to address a big event of the Hindu Mandalam. I feel proud of being a member of the BJP, which is the successor party of Jana Sangh,” said Modi.</p>
						<p>The Prime Minister said Mukherjee could not attend the event, but later when he came to Thiruvananthapuram, he had met Sankar.</p>
						<p>Besides, when Jana Sangh had an all- India conference in Uttar Pradesh, Mukherjee had specially invited Sanker for that session, said the Prime Minister.</p>
						<p>While Modi was unveiling the statue of the former Congress chief minister in Kollam, Congress staged a prayer meeting in front of Sankar’s statue in Thiruvananthapuram. Congress, CPI (M) and their allies had boycotted the Kollam function after SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan asked Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to keep away from the function allegedly under duress from BJP.
						Exclusion of Chandy was construed as part of BJP agenda to usurp the legacy of Sankar and give a Hindu colour for the Congress’ ex-chief minister from 1962 to 64. During the prayer session in the state capital, Congress leaders blasted Natesan and BJP for claiming right over the legacy of Sankar.
						Sankar’s son Mohan and daughter Susheela Kumari attended the Congress prayer meeting. They kept away from the unveiling of the statue in Kollam in protest against Natesan’s bid to make their father an RSS man.</p>
